ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Jacob Gildenblat.

I'm a Deep Learning researcher and a generalist software engineer from Israel.
I do quite a bit of open source, which you can see on my [github](http://github.com/jacobgil). I'm the author of the most widely used [Explainable AI package](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam) for computer vision.
Since 2018 i'm the Co-Founder and CTO of DeePathology.ai, developing an Active Learning based interactive platform for digital pathology, that lets Pathologists create and deploy supervised deep learning algorithms.


Let's get in touch.
